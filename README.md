# Earthquake_Project
## A **Python** project that leverages Pandas, Numpy, Pycountry_convert, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scipy, Geopandas, Shapely, Sklearn, Seaborn, and more to clean and tidy data, perform feature engineering, and create intriguing and insightful visualizations from a dataset containing earthquake events from around the globe that occurred during the 2001-2022 time period.
This project will have 2 Jupyter Notebook files:
- Data_Cleanup_Visualizations.ipynb is the code that cleans and tidies data, does feature engineering, produces visualizations and basic data transformation
- Alert_Classification.ipynb will be the code that performs the supervised classification task of categorizing earthquakes with an alert level

This project accomplishes the following:
- Cleans and tidies earthquake data using **Pandas** and **Numpy**
- Performs feature Engineering using **Pandas**, **Pycountry_convert**, and **Geopandas**
- Visualizes data using **Plotly**, **Matplotlib**, **Shapely**, and **Seaborn**
- Performs basic data transformation for feature correlation checks using **Sklearn**

## How to tweak this project for your own uses
I'd encourage you to clone and rename this project to use for your own purposes. It's a good introduction to data visualization, especially for map visualizations.
